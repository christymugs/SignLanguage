# Sign Language Detection

## Introduction
This Python code utilizes computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to detect and recognize sign language gestures in real-time. It captures input from a webcam or video device, processes the images, and classifies hand gestures into predefined categories representing different signs.

## Features
- Real-time sign language detection using a webcam or video input device.
- Classification of hand gestures into predefined sign categories.
- Easily configurable parameters to adjust model settings and input/output options.
- Modular design allows for easy integration into other projects or applications.

## How it Works
The code processes video frames captured from the input device and applies image processing techniques to detect and isolate hand regions. It then extracts relevant features from these regions and feeds them into a machine learning model for classification. The model outputs the predicted sign gesture, which is displayed in real-time or saved to a file, depending on the configuration.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
  git clone https://github.com/christymugs/SignLanguage.git
2. Install the required dependencies:

## Usage
2. Run `python signlanguage.py` to start the sign language detection program.
3. Ensure your webcam or video input device is connected and accessible.
4. Perform sign gestures in front of the camera, and the program will classify them in real-time.
